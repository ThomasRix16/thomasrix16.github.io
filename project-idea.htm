            <h2>Overview:</h2>
<p>My project idea is something that I am already working on. It involves taking an industry from phone and email to an online platform. This would involve taking current industry participants from all sides of the transaction and creating a workflow that is both transparent and easy to use. Currently these transactions involve anywhere from 2 to 4 parties and can take days to complete. Our solution could take these days long processes and turn it in to half an hour. Therefore, leaving a coded audit trail and make significant inroads into the bribery and corruption rife in the industry. </p>

 <h2>Motivation:</h2> <p>The motivation to build this trading platform is to try and address current market inefficiencies. On any given day, market participants especially brokers are subjected to approximately 5,000 emails, which need to be deciphered, filed and actioned. While not all of these emails are relevant to all industry participants, this represents “death by email”. In order to address the current lack of market transparency, ineffectual data use and lack of value add, a trading platform to complete freight transactions would solve many problems. This coupled with no current single platform that encompasses pre, at and post trade functionality presents a significant market opportunity. </p>


 <h2>Description:</h2> <p>
The platform will be designed to bring all industry participants to the same place to conduct each part of their freight negotiation. From pre-trade elements including freight calculators, AIS vessel positioning data to live indices created by actual market activity will allow industry participants to make informed decisions about their upcoming freight requirements. </p>

<P>We approached the problem with this 3-part approach that allows us initially to have a smaller focus area in bringing the product to market but also has made us aware of what a fully encompassing system will involve. We have split the system features into three areas:</P>

<p>Pre-Trade: Involves the administration and preparation of parties and vessels being ready to bid and fit for use on the system. This includes operations such as vetting, document and compliance accumulation, vessel information systems and performance evaluators.</P>

<p>These procedures ensure that vessels and owners fit the requirements of each of the shipper’s they will bid on cargoes from. Shippers will have their own requirements that will need to be met in combination with the minimum requirements that our platform puts in place for registration and ongoing use of the system. Shippers will have preferences including needing to know who is in the Ownership chain of a vessel, blocking particular counterparties which we can accommodate. Part of this process may also be vetting ships before they are contracted (via Rightship or others).</p>

<p>At Trade: Involves the bidding process and contract execution of the system and will allow the users to negotiate freight agreements in multiple ways. Whether that be by auctions or negotiation, the platform will ensure that all users have an auditable trail of decision making in order to strictly adhere to best business practice and anti-bribery and corruption policies. <br>

  We consider this to begin from the order creation by the shipper and includes notification to all participants, auction process, cooling off/ approval process and then contract creation. This is the part of the process that our platform has remained most focused on and the area at which there is little competitive participation and the largest void to add value. It is from this part of the trade where our platform can capitalise on the opportunity and place Pre and Post Trade processes around this.</p>

<p>Post Trade: The Post Trade elements include all functionality that comes after the contract execution and relates to the operational activities of the voyage and physical A to B voyage completion. In this area there are a range of other service providers however this market is very fragmented, and no provider remains a cut above all else.</p>

<p>
  The Platform: Abilities and Functionality
  In the long term our platform can be an institution that brings the industry forward and solves many of the inefficiencies of the transaction process.</p>

Some of the system abilities and features can be summarised as follows:
<ul>
  <li>Conclude freight agreements for voyage cargoes via either an auction-based process or a tender based process.</li>
  <li>Trading session flexibility in terms of: Session Construction and Process, Demurrage Options, Fuel Price Options, etc.</li>
  <li>Trading Session options that is fully autonomous and can be set for independent selection of the vessel according to most competitive price or other criteria</li>
  <li>Save a full cargo worksheet to organise upcoming market cargoes and automatically place into sessions.</li>
  <li>Manage the ship “subjects” period via the system to ensure transparency and speed in ensuring the contract is fit and vessel suitable.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tools and Technologies:</h2> <p>
This platform will need to be developed to the highest standard of both build and security. It will be built using the Angular App and include C-Sharp APIs along with an MS-SQL database server. Also given the need for it to have full redundancy it will be hosted by Amazon Web Services with back up to 4 dedicated full recovery servers with a 15-minute snapshot. These backup servers are to be in multiple sites at least 30km apart. There will also be a requirement for significant intrusion detection services in order to keep the data as secure as possible. </p>






<h2>Skills required:</h2> <p>
The skills required to engineer this platform are quite high. It would certainly need the skills of a full stack developer who is highly skilled in C++ and Angular along with a highly skilled UI/UX Designer that can make the platform easy to use and intuitive enough that anyone can use it with minimal training. <br>

These developers along with the necessary infrastructure should be relatively easy to come by, however it will be the industry knowledge that needs to be translated in to code that will prove to be the most difficult and time-consuming element.  </p>

<h2>Outcome:</h2> <p>
If the project is successful, the bulk shipping industry will see significant change not just through technology but also to how many jobs are required. There will be a significant shift in how many industry participants carry out their day to day business. While most will be able to adapt, others may need to look elsewhere for employment. The lack of transparency in the industry will be solved by coded audit trails through the negotiations and the amount of email traffic will be greatly reduced. This coupled with actual data being captured will allow for a more transparent and competitive market which should see the industry rationalized and freight costs being reduced. </p>
