<h3>I am an Auditory learner.</h3>
<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">Learning Style Test Results:
  <br>
  Your Scores:<br>
  Auditory: 40%<br>
  Visual: 35%<br>
  Tactile: 25%<br><br>
  </div>

<div class="alert alert-dark" role="alert">
  <b>Auditory</b>
  <p>If you are an auditory learner, you learn by hearing and listening. You understand and remember things you have heard. You store information by the way it sounds, and you have an easier time understanding spoken instructions than written ones. You often learn by reading out loud because you have to hear it or speak it in order to know it.</p>
  
  <p>As an auditory learner, you probably hum or talk to yourself or others if you become bored. People may think you are not paying attention, even though you may be hearing and understanding everything being said. (Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency, 2020)</P>

<H3>The Big 5 Personality Test Results</h3>
  <div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
Openness: 56% <br>
Conscientiousness: 65%<br>
Extraversion: 56%<br>
Agreeableness: 58%<br>
Neuroticism: 33%<br>
  </div>

<b>How does your mind work…</b><br>
<p>You take in real-world information about the world around you and apply your own interpretations. You are good at noticing details, although you also want to understand the larger meaning of what you observe so that you can put things in context. You can be quite creative when you are working in an area of special expertise or knowledge, although you also know when it is time to abandon fantasy and get back to the real world. (Truity Inc., 2020)</p>

<h1>What do my results mean to me?</h1><br>
<p>The results of these tests seem to capture my personality and learning style quite well. The results of the Myers-Briggs Test show pragmatism and resourcefulness which is something that I believe to be useful when it comes to working within a team. While the Big 5 Personality test shows that I have a high percentage of agreeableness which should work in my favour when completing a group task. The Myers-Briggs test also shows that I am an extrovert which again can be an asset when working in groups. </p>

<b>How these results will influence behavior in a group?</b><br>
<p>When working in a team, I need to ensure that my extroversion does not come across as overbearing. However, my strong results of Agreeableness in the Big 5 Personality test should assist in working within a group. </P>

<b>How should you take these results into account when forming a group? </b><br>
<p>While it would have been better to be able to evaluate all team, members results prior to forming a group, taking in to account each other’s personality traits is always important when forming any team. </p>
