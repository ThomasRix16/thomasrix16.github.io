<b>About Me:</b><br>
I was born in Sydney in January 1990 and my father’s work took us from there to Central Queensland before settling in Brisbane. I completed high school in 2006 before spending 2007 as a Rotary International Exchange student in Zurich Switzerland. I returned in 2008 to start university and work. Work soon took over from study as I found it more stimulating and of course gained financial independence. I work multiple roles in retail, before dabbling in Real estate and Logistics before I found my career. I currently work as a Shipbroker in Sydney, where I live with my wife. Into to IT will be my last subject in my Bachelor of Business (Logistics and Supply Chain Management). 
</P>
<p><b>My Interest in IT:</b><br>
I assume that as with most people born in the 1990s, my interest in IT has stemmed from growing up at a similar pace to technological developments in the world. The intrigue that comes with learning a new piece of software or experiencing the newest piece of hardware has always been fascinating to me. </P>
<P>
In my current workplace I am always looking at how we can do things better or more efficiently through technology. Not just in assisting my colleagues work smarter but also working on developing solutions for our clients. I am currently in the midst of a large-scale platform development for some of the world’s largest miners. </P>

<p>While my skill set is certainly not in the underlying coding of these platforms, I thrive in the development of these platforms and watching them grow from nothing to something functional on the screen. Taking an industry that is still seemingly ancient in its business practices and taking them online has been one of the greatest challenges of my career. Seeing it through to completion will certainly be a great achievement. </p>

As mentioned above, I am certainly keen to implement solutions through IT in to not just my current business but seeing that technology used in other areas of Logistics and Supply Chain Management. This is the reason I chose RMIT, for its degree in Logistics and Supply Chain Management as well as its focus on technology.  </p>
